🍌 Bananagram Game (Tkinter + Python)
====================================


This is a Bananagram-inspired word-building game built with Python’s `tkinter` GUI toolkit. 
Players drag and place letters on a grid to form valid English words, racing against the clock to maximize their score.  

------------------------------------
✨ Features
------------------------------------
- Interactive Grid Board: Place letters on a 25×25 grid using drag & click.
- Randomized Letter Distribution: Tiles are randomly drawn from a shuffled pool.
- Countdown Timer (2 minutes): The game runs against a timer with automatic game-over.
- Word Validation: Uses the NLTK `words` corpus to validate English words.
- Game Actions:
  * More Character → Draws additional tiles (limited to 4 times).
  * Peel → Draws a new tile if the rack is empty.
  * Dump → Exchanges one letter for three new tiles.
  * Banana → Submits your board and checks for valid words.
  * Reset → Resets the entire game.

  Successfully matched words are highlighted on the grid.
